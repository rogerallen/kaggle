Kaggle Competition Code
Roger Allen aka https://www.kaggle.com/rogerallen
February, 2017

Much of this code came from the Practical Deep Learning for Coders
http://course.fast.ai/ course.

See https://github.com/fastai/courses for that code and follow the
course to understand the basics of how I'm (mis)using it.  I thought
I'd just share my code in a spirit of openness.

Since that code is Apache V2.0 Licensed.  I will continue with that
license for my modifications.
